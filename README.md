# FOODHUB-ENTERPRISE-TECHNICAL-ANALYSIS-REPORT-FOR-THE-YEAR-2019
I recently completed this Foodhub enterprise sales data analysis project, This project seeks to analyse sales performance of Foodhub enterprise and the salespersons, the products and the customers in the different regions and yearly sales. This technical analysis aims to improve the organisation’s productivity and boost revenue generation.
The dataset used contains: product name, salesperson, region, year, income/revenue, customers, etc. This data was analysed using Microsoft Excel, pivot tables and charts down to it visualization.
Story of Data: This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, and it is secondary data. The data, presented in rows and columns, tells a story of the different grocery products sold by the firm in different countries. It also highlights different quantities purchased, to ship, and for shipping. It has the following in the column: product name, salesperson, region, year, income/revenue, and customers.
Data Splitting and Preprocessing: After downloading the data, observation was carried out for duplicates, and inconsistency but the data was found to be clean already. There were no missing values, upon observation, the data that has stand-alone abilities where categorised as independent data like the salesperson, region, product name and those that depends on the above mentioned were classified dependent data.
The industry, is a grocery store (food and beverage) with revenue means, and the stakeholders are; Chief executives, Top managers, Investor, Customers and Product Consumers.
Value to the Industry: As a product and service organisation, revenue and more revenue is the target while delivering services, so this project will help the organisation know the untapped areas, reach customers and redefine its revenue generation. Success means expansion to other countries for more revenue. Success here is having multiple revenue means.

PRE-ANALYSIS:
Potential Analysis/ Questions
Best performing region by revenue generated, performance analysis of each salesperson by revenue generated, customer performance analysis by revenue, customer performance analysis by quantity purchased, payment type usage, best performing goods for the year by quantity. Best-performing month or week, region with most sales.
Initial/ Potential Insight
1. Fine-tune the best region and explore measures to gain more growth against competitors, e.g. more advertising. We can also fine-tune the least performing region and implement measures done in the best performing region, and ensure that these measures are kept in place, e.g. transferring a salesperson from the region with great sales to the region with low sales to ensure they enact measures enacted at the best performing region. The most used payment type, stocking the most purchased goods, especially in regions where they are sold more, the countries that received more shipments in the period under review. The best category of products based on sales and the amount of revenue it generated, regional performance, and monthly sales trend.
   
IN ANALYSIS INSIGHTS:
Jan performed least for the year and i recommend to stakeholders that he should be retrenched or sent for some trainings on sales and customer retention and Nancy for promotion or bonus be given to her.

Analyst team recommend Company D for discount or free nomination for company of the year award and marketer or promotion team be sent to educate lower performing companies.

The data team recommend that measures used in December that yielded that sales revenue be repeated in January and ensure strict compliance.

The measures used in the North region be repeated in West and if possible, move sales person from North to West for policy implementation.

Products in the beverages category should be stocked more to avoid stockouts and increase revenue. Products selling between 1000–2000 should be stocked more, thereby avoiding stock out since it sells the highest.

Set a sub-headquarters in New York to ensure more customers get interested in lower shipping fee, encouraging prior unacquired customers. the region recorded the highest sales by revenue of $141,660.34.
Analysis techniques: Pivot table, standard Excel table.
Post-Analysis and Insights: This analysis reveal a key correlation between the revenue generated, salesperson and region, it was discovered that best performing sales person had the highest revenue and belong to the best region too.

Analysis Recommendations
1. Recommendation, Nancy Freeshafer the top performing sales person, should be rewarded with bonuses or promotion or both.
2. Jan is recommended to the executives for retrenchment or sent for further training to help him improve on sales policy implementation and customer retention
3. Company D is recommended for award as the best customer for the year 2019 or rewarded with bonuses or discount or both to encourage them to perform more.
4. Company K should be encouraged to buy more, initiate more customer friendly policies and create more awareness of mutual benefits.
5. Northern region is recommended for best performing region, as such a regional office, warehouse or special line of communication be established between them and the company.
6. Western region perform poorly for the year 2019, recommendation send the sales persons here in exchange for top persons in the Northern region. they can also be trained on customer retention and how to enforce good GMP for sales.
7. The revenue sum of $435,036.16 was gotten, this should be compared with the organisation expected income to ascertain the level of improvement and where improvement is needed.
8. New York top the top 5 City for 2019, while Chicago performs the least recommendation would be to do a cross fertilization of ideas between the staff of these cities. For the items between 0–1000 that sold the highest recommendation would be that more of that product range be stocked to enable more sales and also generate more revenue. The product not doing in the west can be sent to the North where they doing very fine.
9. Since observation shows that almost every sales person has beverage as part of the top 3 selling product, recommendation is that beverages should be stocked in every City, and all sales person be mandated to sell it. If there is any method; adverts, publicity or promotion done for beverages, recommendation is that same be applied to poor selling products
10. December sales exceeded those of any other month for the top salesperson; therefore, all sales should be encouraged to apply the method used by the top salesperson in December in other months that are not doing so well.
CONCLUSION: From this analysis, insights discovered are that Nancy Freeshafer is the top sales person, Foodhub Enterprise is well established in the North region with a reasonable market share, Jan is the least revenue generating sales person, Foodhub needs to engage more customers in the west, driven sales in the west and engage in promotional activities. Beverge is a product that must not go “out of stock”.
In the cause of this analysis some of the limitations were inadequate sales data for the analysis making sales trend inconclusive, no consideration for logistics data which can influence sales and other staff in the facilities were not considered, based on this, future research should be broader in the years to consider and also include other factors like company logistics arrangement, data gathering process as well.
